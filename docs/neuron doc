Neruon

Type: Add, Average
Convolutionary: Yes, No
Activation function: Identity, Binary Step, Logistic, Hyperbolic tangent, ReLU, SoftPlus, ELU, SELU, Leaky ReLU, PReLU, SiLU, Mish, Gaussian

200 inputs

Neuron: 0 - (n-1)
Frame: 0 - (n-1)
Weight: -double - double
Convolution: -2 if neuron is non convolutionary, -1 if input is convolutionary, 0 - (#convolutions of neuron) if input is targeted

e.g.

Add, Yes, Identity

Input 0: Neuron 0, Frame 0, Weight 1, Convolution -1
Input 1: Neuron 0, Frame 1, Weight -1, Convolution -1

This neuron should compare the open of each stock of the day before to today
